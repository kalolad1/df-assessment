    "content": "Crohn's disease is a chronic, idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy, transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, most commonly the terminal ileum and proximal colon. The disease typically presents with symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and sometimes fever; extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., joint, skin, and eye involvement) occur in up to 50% of patients.\n\nThe inflammation in Crohn's disease is segmental (\"skip lesions\") and transmural, which predisposes patients to complications such as strictures, fistulas, and abscesses. The etiology is multifactorial, involving genetic susceptibility (e.g., NOD2 mutations), dysregulated immune responses, altered gut microbiota, and environmental factors. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic evidence of chronic intestinal inflammation, and requires exclusion of alternate causes.\n\nCrohn's disease is distinct from ulcerative colitis in its ability to affect any GI segment and its transmural, discontinuous pattern of inflammation. Management is individualized and may include pharmacologic therapy (corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics), nutritional support, and sometimes surgery, though surgery is not curative.\n\nReferences:\n1.

    "title": "Ulcerative Colitis - Inflammatory Bowel Disease",
    "content": "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the large intestine, characterized by continuous mucosal inflammation that typically starts in the rectum and extends proximally in a contiguous fashion through the colon. The exact cause remains unknown, but genetic, environmental, and immune factors are implicated.\n\nPatients most commonly present with rectal bleeding, diarrhea (often bloody), abdominal pain, urgency, and tenesmus. The disease course is usually relapsing and remitting, with periods of active symptoms alternating with remission. Extraintestinal manifestations, such as arthritis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, can occur in up to a third of patients.\n\nDiagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic evidence of continuous colonic inflammation starting at the rectum, and histologic confirmation of chronic colitis. Ulcerative colitis is distinct from Crohn's disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and involves transmural inflammation.\n\nComplications include anemia, toxic megacolon, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer, especially with long-standing or extensive disease. Management focuses on inducing and maintaining remission with medications such as 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics; surgery may be required for refractory or complicated cases. Regular surveillance colonoscopy is recommended to monitor for dysplasia and cancer.\n\nReferences:\n1. ACG Clinical Guideline Update: Ulcerative Colitis in Adults.

    "title": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder",
    "content": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or a mix of both, in the absence of detectable structural or biochemical abnormalities. The diagnosis is clinical, based on symptom-based criteria—most recently, the Rome IV criteria—which require abdominal pain, on average, at least one day per week in the last three months, associated with changes in stool frequency or form, and/or related to defecation, with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis.\n\nIBS is common, affecting approximately 4–10% of the population in the United States and other Western countries, with a higher prevalence in women and individuals under 50 years of age. The condition is subtyped based on predominant stool pattern: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M), and unclassified IBS.\n\nThe pathophysiology of IBS is multifactorial, involving altered gut-brain axis signaling, visceral hypersensitivity, dysbiosis, immune activation, and psychosocial factors. IBS significantly impairs quality of life and work productivity, and is associated with increased healthcare utilization and costs.\n\nDiagnosis is made by careful history and physical examination, with limited testing to exclude other conditions when alarm features are absent. Management is tailored to symptom subtype and severity, and may include dietary and lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy, and psychological interventions.\n\nCommunity Insights: IBS is a disorder of gut-brain interaction diagnosed by a positive symptom-based approach, not as a diagnosis of exclusion, and requires ruling out other conditions only when indicated by risk factors or atypical features. The explanation to patients should emphasize that IBS is a functional impairment of the gut, not caused by food intake, and that management is multidisciplinary and tailored to the most bothersome symptom, with realistic discussion of treatment limitations.\n\nReferences:\n1.
